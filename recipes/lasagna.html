    </ul>
    <h2>Steps to Cook</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and garlic, sauté until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef or sausage, cooking until browned. Drain any excess fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and red wine (if using). Season with basil, oregano, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Simmer the sauce on low heat for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add the lasagna noodles and cook according to package instructions until al dente.</li>
        <li>Drain the noodles and lay them flat on a clean kitchen towel to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, Parmesan, parsley, salt, and pepper. Mix well until smooth.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Place 3-4 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, overlapping slightly.</li>
        <li>Spread a layer of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then sprinkle with mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers: meat sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, and mozzarella, until all the ingredients are used. Finish with a final layer of meat sauce and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan.</li>
        <li>Cover the lasagna with foil and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Let the lasagna cool for 10 minutes before slicing.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil if desired, and serve with a side of garlic bread or salad.</li>
    </ol>
    Enjoy your Lasagna!
