    <p>Verum Arisi Adai is a simple, traditional South Indian dosa made purely with rice, without any dal (lentils), making it light and crispy.</p> 
    <p>It is often served with a tangy and spicy Tomato Chutney, creating a perfect balance of flavors for breakfast or a light meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients Required</h2>
    <h3>For the Verum Arisi Adai (Rice Dosa):</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups raw rice (any short-grain or parboiled rice works)</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Water for soaking and grinding</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee for cooking the dosa</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Tomato Chutney:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ripe tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1-2 dry red chilies (adjust to spice preference)</li>
        <li>1 tsp mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1 tsp urad dal (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>A pinch of asafoetida (hing)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh coriander leaves for garnish</li>
    <h2>Steps to Cook</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Soak the Rice: </b> Rinse the rice thoroughly in water and soak it for at least 4-5 hours or overnight.</li>
        <li><b>Grind the Batter: </b> Drain the soaked rice and grind it in a blender or wet grinder with enough water to form a smooth, slightly thick batter. The batter should have a pouring consistency, like pancake batter.</li>
        <li><b>Fermentation (Optional):</b> Traditionally, the batter can be fermented for 6-8 hours or overnight for a mild tangy flavor, but this step can be skipped if you prefer instant dosa.</li>
        <li><b>Add Salt: </b> Once the batter is ready, add salt and mix well.</li>
        <li><b>Heat the Griddle: </b> Heat a flat dosa tawa (griddle) over medium heat. Once hot, drizzle a few drops of oil and spread it across the surface with a paper towel or a halved onion to season the tawa.</li>
        <li><b>Spread the Batter: </b> Pour a ladleful of batter onto the center of the tawa and spread it in a circular motion to form a thin dosa.</li>
        <li><b>Cook the Dosa: </b> Drizzle a little oil or ghee around the edges. Cook until the edges start to turn golden and crisp. Flip if desired, or serve straight from the tawa once crispy.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process for the remaining batter.</li>
        <li><b>Heat Oil: </b> In a pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil. Add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, and urad dal. Let them splutter.</li>
        <li><b>Add Garlic and Chilies: </b> Add chopped garlic and red chilies, sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
        <li><b>Cook Tomatoes and Onion: </b> Add chopped onions and sauté until translucent. Then, add chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and break down, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li><b>Season: </b> Add salt and a pinch of asafoetida. Cook until the mixture thickens and the raw smell of tomatoes is gone.</li>
        <li><b>Blend: </b> Allow the mixture to cool slightly, then blend it into a smooth chutney. Adjust seasoning as needed.</li>
        <li><b>Optional Tempering: </b> You can add another tempering of mustard seeds and curry leaves on top of the chutney for extra flavor.</li>
        <li><b>Garnish: </b> Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>
        <li>Serve the crispy Verum Arisi Adai hot with the tangy Tomato Chutney on the side.</li>
    </ol>
    Enjoy your Verum Arisi Adai!
